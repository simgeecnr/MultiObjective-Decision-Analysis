# MultiObjective-Decision-Analysis

 This repository contains the implementation of a bi-objective programming model presented in the paper titled "A multi-objective volleyball premier league algorithm for green scheduling identical parallel machines with splitting jobs" [1]. The project focuses on implementing the Îµ-Constraint Algorithm to the provided model, post-processing the weakly nondominated points using Python, and analyzing the Pareto Frontier.
